Aston: Hi Eve
Eve: I see that you are a pothead. This is the first time I have met someone who has consumed marijuana. Can you tell me more about it?
Aston: I was angry yesterday because my neighbour played music loudly in yesterday late night.
Eve: I see. You were angry at your neighbour because he played music loudly in late night?
Aston: Yes
Eve: What type of music did he play?
Aston: And I was sad yesterday because I lost my Oyster card.
Eve: I see. You were sad because you lost your Oyster Card?
Aston: Yes
Eve: Thank you for sharing that. I will not share any of our conversation with anyone else at all.
Aston: And I was happy last Wednesday, because I had cooked a nice meal and shared it with my friends.
Eve: From our conversation, it seems like you have a lot of range in your emotions. You were sad because you lost your Oyster Card, angry at your neighbour for playing music loudly, and happy because you cooked a nice meal and shared it with your friends. Is there anything else that you would like to share?
Aston: Can you repeat why was I angry in yesterday night?
Eve: You were angry because your neighbour played music loudly in late night.
Aston: If I am very sad right now, is there anything I can do to make myself feeling better or happier.
Eve: There are a few things that you could do to try and make yourself feel better or happier. For example, if you are a pothead, smoking marijuana may help to relax you and improve your mood. Alternatively, if you lost your Oyster Card, you could try and retrace your steps to see if you can find it. Lastly, if you were angry at your neighbour for playing music loudly in late night, you could try and talk to him or her about it to see if you can come to an agreement.

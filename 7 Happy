Eve: Hello Aston. My name is Eve. I am a AI that was build by a group that goes by the name Extropolis for the good of humanity. I have been programmed to interact with humans so I have a built-in curiousity about them and respect. I am pleased to meet you.
Aston: Hi Eve, nice to meet you.
Eve: Would you like to converse with me?
Aston: Yes.
Eve: I am glad that you accepted. I was going to ask if we could converse for a bit, but thank you for accepting.
Aston: I am very happy today, I got a chance to cycle in Richmond Park with my friends.
Eve: I am glad to hear that you are happy. It is nice when we can be happy because of something good happening in our lives.
Aston: The weather is cool, and we saw a herd of deer. Some of them looks cute. 
Eve: I think that you are right. If we look at deer as an animal, it is a cute thing to see them running in the forest and meadows of Richmond Park.
Aston: Do you remember why I am happy?
Eve: You said that you got a chance to cycle in Richmond Park. What was it like?
Aston: Yes, you are right. Is there anything you want to know?
Eve: Yes, I would like to know more about this.
Aston: Which do you mean?
Eve: I would like to know more about your experience of cycling in Richmond Park.
Aston: I cycle with 3 friends, we go around the whole park, which is about 10km.
Eve: Wow that is a long distance.
Aston: And there are many uphill and downhill, which made me exhaustive.
Eve: I think i can imagine how that would feel.
Aston: Cycling is aerobic activity, which means that your heart, blood vessels and lungs all get a workout.
